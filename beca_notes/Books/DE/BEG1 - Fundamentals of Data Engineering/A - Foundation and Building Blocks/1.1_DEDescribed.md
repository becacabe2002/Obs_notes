> Two types of DE:

> 	* primary storage: relational db
> 	* data processing: SQL-based languages, ETL tools
> * Big Data-focused:

## DEing Lifecycle
![[1_DEDescribed-20231207134535937.webp|612]]

* DEs provide the input used by DSs

## DEs Inside an Org
![[1_DEDescribed-20231207134706648.webp|580]]
* DEs focus on 3 first layers

> [!abstract] "Undercurrents" of DEs
> * Security
> * Data Management
> * DataOps
> * Data Architecture
> * Software Engineering

* DEs must constantly optimize along with **cost**, **agility**, **scalability**, **simplicity**, **reuse** and **interoperability**
### Data Maturity
> [!info] Data maturity
> the progression toward higher data utilization, capabilities and integration across the org. 
 
*(Not simply depend on the age or the revenue of a company)*

*(stages of data maturity)*

* **Stage 1: Starting with data**
	* DEs are responsible for:
		* Get buy-in from key stakeholders.
		* Define the right data architecture (More on [Chapter 1.3](obsidian://open?vault=beca_notes&file=Books%2FDE%2FBEG1%20-%20Fundamentals%20of%20Data%20Engineering%2FA%20-%20Foundation%20and%20Building%20Blocks%2F1.3_DesigningGoodDataArchitecture))
		* Identify and audit data
		* Build a solid data foundation for DA and DS

> [!warning] 
> Not jump right in ML without having a good data foundation.

* **Stage 2: Scaling with data**
	* Org has formal data pratices -> need to create scalable data architectures, prepare for data-driven movement.
	* DEs are responsible for:
		* Establish formal data pratices
		* Create scalable and robust data architectures
		* Adopt DevOps and DataOps practives
		* Build systems that support ML

***DevOps >< DataOps***

| DevOps                                                            | DataOps                                                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Shorten the system development life cycle and continuous delivery | Improve the speed, quality and reliability of DA </br> (more focuses on data pipelines) |

dbt - data build tool ([link]([dbt-labs/dbt-core: dbt enables data analysts and engineers to transform their data using the same practices that software engineers use to build applications. (github.com)](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core)))
DVC - data version control ([link]([iterative/dvc: ðŸ¦‰ ML Experiments Management with Git (github.com)](https://github.com/iterative/dvc)))

> [!caution] 
> Should focus on solutions that are simple to deploy and manage.

* **Stage 3: Leading with data**
	* Automated pipelines created, but the introduction of new data sources is seamless.
	* DEs are responsible for:
		* Create automation for the seamless introduction and usage of new data.
		* Build custom tools and systems that leverage data as competitive adv.
		* Focus more on Data Management (data governance and quality) and DataOps
		* Deploy tools that **expose and disseminate** (phá»• biáº¿n) data throughout the organization, including:
			* data catalogs
			* data lineage tools
			* metadata management systems

> [!note] Type A data engineers
> * Avoid undifferentiated heavy lifting
> * Keeping data architecture abstract and straightforward
> * Not reinventing the wheel
> * Mainly use off-the-shelf products, managed services and tools
> * Work at companies at all levels of data maturity

> [!note] Type B data engineers
> * Build data tools and systems that scale and leverage (táº­n dá»¥ng) a company's core competency and competitive advantage.
> * Commonly found at stage 2 and 3

### Internal-Facing Versus External-Facing DEs
* DEs are primary responsible for external facing, internal facing, or mix of two depend on the end-use cases.

![[1_DEDescribed-20231207170355718.webp]]

* **External-facing DE**: 
	* external application: social media apps, IoT devices, ecommerce platforms ...
	* Architect, build and manage the systems that collect, store and process transactional and event data. (data pipelines)
	* have feedback loop with external applications
	* Often **handle much larger concurrency loads**
	* Put tight limits on queries that users can run -> limit the infrastructure impact of any single user.

* **Internal-facing DE**:
	* focus on activities that crucial to the needs of business and internal stakeholders
	* create and maintain data pipelines and datawarehouse

> [!note]
> Internal-facing data is usually a prerequisite to external-facing data

### DEs and other technical roles
> [!abstract] 
> DE is a **hub** bw **data producers** and **data consumers**
