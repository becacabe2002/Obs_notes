## 1. Software platforms
* Semantics:
	* Architectural
	* Computational
	* Figurative
	* Political

> [!info] Software platforms
> Extensible code-bases provide core functionality and are supplemented by modular services. (scalable way)

* Act as intermediaries connecting different set of user groups (Airbnb, Wolt, Uber), exchange their values (own nothing)

### Types of software platforms
* **OS platforms**:
* **Mobile platforms**: Android, IOS
* **Video game platforms**: Steam, GOG
* **Engagement or social media platform**: Tiktok
* **Generative AI platform**: OpenAI, HuggingFace
* **E-commerce platform:** Amazon, Shopify
* **Fintech & payment platform**: GG pay, Paypal
* **Consumer demand platforms:**
## 2. Business perspective of software

> [!note] Business Models
> Abstraction of business, used to visualize business
> 

* Design a software platform requires understanding of different aspects of BM:
	* Relevant stakeholders
	* Business needs
	* Value offerings
	* Customer interactions
	* Business Operations
	* Resources
	* Cost and revenue returns

> [!faq] What differentiates platform business from traditional business ?
> * in tb, business value flows from one direction to the other
> * in pb, business value flows in multiple directions
> * pbs bring multiple sets of users together
> * Asset ownership and asset control in tb, while pbs focus on resource orchestration (plan & coordinate the interaction between different user groups)
> * Unlike tb, pb involve external interaction

*One direction flow: farmers sell their crops to flour mills. Flour mills sell flour to distributors, and then it was sold to supermarkets and final, it comes to consumers.*
## 3. 2-sided markets

> [!info] 2-sided markets
> presence of two or more unique user groups that interact and create value for each other.

### Challenges of 2-sided markets

> [!attention] Chicken and egg problem
> * requires a base of mass exsitence

> [!attention] Platform competition
> * potential competitors in the same dominance

> [!attention] Platform pricing
> Determine the price for each side is hard
> * Subsidy side:

> [!attention] Threat of envelopment


## 4. Network Effects
> [!info] 

* Refer to the value that one set of users attach to the other set of users

* Same-side
* Cross-side


> [!abstract] 
> * Software platforms are extensible codebase and the exchange of values among different user grps.
> * We use pricing strategies to balance subsidy and money sides
> * 2-sided
