Just focus on offline measures since online metrics is expensive and time-consuming.

2 Way to test offline:
* Train-Test Split
* K-Fold Cross-Validation

## Different offline metrics
Two type of evaluation metrics
### Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
* Different between actual rating and predicted value

$$
MAE = \frac{1}{n} \sum |y - \hat{y}|
$$

### Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)


### Hit Rate (HR)

### Average Reciprocal Hit Rate (ARHR)

### Cumulative Hit Rate (rHR)

### Coverage

### Diversity

### Novelty

### Churn

### Responsiveness
