*(V Model - different test levels)*

1. Unit Testing: Does each unit (class, method, ..) function correctly?
	* Smallest programming units
	* Strategies: Blackbox and Whitebox
	* Tools: JUnit
	* Techniques

2. Integration Testing: how do components work together?
	* Strategies: Bottom-up, top-down testing

3. System testing: does it work within the overall system?
