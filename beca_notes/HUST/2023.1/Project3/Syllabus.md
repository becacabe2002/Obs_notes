### Machine Learning - Deep Learning
* **Node/ Neuron**: the basic component of a neural network that receives one or more inputs, processes them and then returns an output.
* **Synapse**: the connection between neurons and layers inside a NN
* **Layer**: a group of neurons working together during the same phase of the processing procedure.

* **Supervised Learning**: a type of machine learning in which the neural network is trained with input data and the corresponding output data, which serves as a "teacher".
* **Unsupervised Learning**: a type of machine learning where the neural network is trained with input data but without any output data as guide.
	-> The network must find the structure or patterns in the data itself.
* **Reinforcement Learning**: a type of machine learning in which the model is trained through a system of rewards and penalties, enabling it to learn from ít own decisions.

* **Logistic Regression** (hồi quy): statistical method used for binary classification to predict one or two possible outcomes (yes/no; true/false)
	* It models the relationship between a dependent binary variable and one or more independent variables
	* Calculate the probility that a given input belongs to a particular class and use a logistic function to make predictions.
	* It is a linear model that is often used as a simple baseline for classification tasks.

* **Extreme Gradient Boosting** (XGBoost): an ML Algo which effective in both classification and regression tasks
	* Build an ensemble (hòa hợp, toàn thể) of decision trees sequentially. (Aims to correct the errors made by the previous trees).

* **Light GBM**: Another gradient boosting framework, but has a different approach to building decision trees.
	* Use histogram-based (dua tren bieu do) algo, which makes it faster and memory-efficient compared to XGBoost.
	* Well-suited for large datasets an can provide competitive results in terms of predictive accuracy.

* **Random Forest**: Ensemble learning technique for both classification and regression tasks.
	*  Build a collection of trees and combine their predictions to make a final prediction.
	* Each tree is constructed independently and can handle different subsets of data and features
	-> Robust, less prone to overfitting.

* **F1-score**: Metric used to evaluate the performance of a classification model (in situations where there is a class outnumbers the other).
	* Combine two metrics: **precision** and **recall**
		* Precision: measure how many of the "positive" predictions made by the model were correct.
		* Recall: measure how many of the positive class samples present in the dataset were correctly identified by the model.
	* Range between 0 and 1 (higher means better model performance). 
	* It is particularly valuable in cases where false positives or false negatives have significant consequences.

* **VANET**: "Vehicular Ad-hoc Network" - a specialized type of ad-hoc network that is designed to facilitate communication and data exchange among vehicles and between vehicles and roadside infrastructure.

* **Ad-hoc Network**: decentralized types of wireless network, in which devices (nodes) communicate directly with each other without the need for centrailized infrastructure (ex: router or access point).
	* Devices within the network can dynamic form connections with one another to establish communication, share data, and collaborate.

* **Heuristic** 
* **Metaheuristic**
