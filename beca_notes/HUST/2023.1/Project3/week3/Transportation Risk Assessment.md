> [!info] Transportation risk assessment - TRA 
> * essential aspect of risk management
> * promote identification of major contributors
> **-> Come up with strategies for risk reduction.**

* Does TRA consider both internal and external factors?
	* **External:** hazards, routes and impacts
	* **Internal**: toxic, flammability, explosivity, and security
## Internal factors

* **Warehouse efficiency**: order picking, packaging and inventory organization

* **Driver performance**: skill and performance of drivers, adherence to safety regulations

* **Vehicle maintainance**: poor maintainance -> unexpected breakdowns

## External factors
> [!question] Which external factors can impact delivery time?

* **Traffic Congestion**: accidents, rush hours, construction or special events.

* **Weather Condition**: adverse weather conditions (storms, heavy rain, snow, fog ...)
	* Natural Disaters: earthquake, hurricans, wildfires -> disrupt transportation routes, damage infastructure.

* **Road and Infrastructure Conditions**: state of the road network and infrastructure
	* Road maintenance, bridges, tunnels, railway track ...
	* Poor road conditions/infrastructure -> detours (duong vong) and delays.

* **Legal and Regulatory Requirements**: Driver have to comply to transportation regulations
	* Speed limits, driving hours, mandatory rest periods -> influence time taken to complete a delivery.

* **Customs (Hải quan) and Border Controls**: for international shipments
	* If there is documentation issues or inspections required.

* **Fuel Price**: Fluctation in fuel prices can impact transportation costs and may influence routing decisions.
	* Higher fuel prices -> Changes in driving behavior (conserve fuel) -> Affect

* **Labor Strikes and Disruptions**: Labor strikes, work stoppages at ports, airports or distribution centers -> Interuptions in the supply chain.

* **Security Checks**: cargo inspections and security screenings (delivery by plane and over sea) -> add extra time

* Political and Geopolitical Factors:

* **Route Selection**: toll roads (đường thu phí), road quality, elevation changes
