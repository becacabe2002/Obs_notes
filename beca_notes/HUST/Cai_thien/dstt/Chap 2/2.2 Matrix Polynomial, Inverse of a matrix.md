## 1. Matrix polynomial
With A,B are square n-level matrices, we have:
* $A*B$ is a n-level square matrix
* $B*A$ is a n-level square matrix
* $A * A ... * A$ is a square matrix which has the same level with A

Have Polynomial $P_m(x)=a_mx^m + a_{m-1}x^{m-1} ... + a_1x + a_0$
Replace $x$ with square matrix $A$, we have $P_m(A)=a_mA^m + a_{m-1}A^{m-1} ... + a_1A + a_0$ which is a matrix polynomial

## 2. Inverse of a matrix
