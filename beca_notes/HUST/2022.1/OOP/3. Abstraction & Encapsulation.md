## 1. Abstraction
>[!info] Abstraction
>Reduce and factor out details so that one can focus on a few concepts at a time

* Objects in reality are complex
-> **Need to be simplified by ingoring all the unnecessary details**

>[!note]
>Only **extract** related, important information the the problem.

```java
// Options for the wash cycle
type WashOptions = {
	dryLevel: 'low'|'medium'|'high'
	temp: 'cold'
	dur: 'hour'
	eco: false
}

// the abstraction
class WashingMachine{
	// private instance vars
	
	public startCycle (Options: WashOptions): void{
	//Parse the options
	// get access to the physical layer
	// Convert options into commands
	// more low-level code...
	}
	// more methods
}
```

* Abstraction is a view of an entity containing only related properties in a context.

*  Class is the result of the abs, which represents a group of entities with the same properties in a specific view.

### Class >< Objects
|Class|Objects|
|---|---|
|Is aconcept model, describing entities|Real entities|
|A prototype/blueprint, defining common properties and methods of objects|An instance of a class, building from the blueprint|
|An abstraction of a set of objects|Each object has a class specifying its data and behavior. <br> Data of different objects are different.|

> [!info] Class in UML
![[Pasted image 20221115144531.png]]

> [!info] Attribute
> A named characteristic of a class. 
> 

*  All instances of the class have this attribute.

* A class can have no attributes or many attributes

> [!info] Operation Visibility
> Used to enforce encapsulation

[[Java Modifiers]]

> [!note] How is visibility noted in UML
> `+` - public
> `#` - protected
> `-` - private
> `~` - package access

## 2. Class Building
> [!note] Class Construction
> ***Class name***
> - Specify what the abstraction is capturing
> - Should be singular, short and clear identify the concept
> 
> ***Data elements***
>- The pieces of data that an instance of the class holds
> 
> ***Operations/Messages***
>- List of messages that instances can receive.
> 
> ***Methods***
>- Implementations of the messages that each instance can receive

### Package
> [!info] PACKAGE
> A set of classes that have some logic relation between them.

* Considered as a directory, a place to organize classes in order to locate them easily.

* Avoid **name conflict** : different packages can have classes with the same name.

* Can protect class and their members from outside access.

> [!example] 
> `java.lang`, `javax.swing`, `java.io` 
> 
> User defined package:
> - Separated by “.”
> - Convention for naming package: use lower letters only

> [!caution] 
> Each source file can have only one package declaration command at the top. If we use not use this command, the file is in default package.

## 3. Encapsulation and data hiding
* An object have two view:
	* ***Internal view*** - details on attributes and methods of the corresponding class.
	* ***External view*** - services provided by the obj and how the obj communicates with all the rest of the system

> [!info] Encapsulation
> Data/attributes and behaviors/methods are encapsulated in a class.

> [!info] Data hiding 
> Data is hidden inside the class and can only be accessed and modified from the methods (***getter*** and ***setter***)

![[Pasted image 20221115213932.png]]

### Data hiding mechanism
* Data member (with `private` modifier) can only be accessed from methods in the class.
	* Other objects want to access to the private data must perform via public func 

> [!note] Accessor (getter)
> return the current value of an attribute

* There are 3 query types:
	* ***Simple query*** - what is the value of var
	
	* ***Conditional query*** - return true or false based on conditions with vars
	
	* ***Complex query*** - perform complex manipulation with value of vars (equations)

> [!caution] Getter should not make any changes to the current

## 4. Object Creation and Communication
> [!caution] Data initialization
> Data need to be initialized before being used to avoid errors.

* for simple/basic data typ, use operator `=`
* for creating objects, need to use constructor method

> [!caution] Constructor
> * Every class must have at least one constructor
> * A constructor **can't** use `abstract, static, final, native, synchronized` but `public, private` or default (used in package only)

```java
public BankAccount(){ // default constructor without @param
	owner = "none";
	balance = 10000;
}

public BankAccount(String str, double d){
	this.owner = o;
	this.balance = b;
}
```

### Object declaration and initialization

```java
ClassName obj_name = new Constructor(@param);
```

* return a reference pointing to the new object.
> [!caution] 
> * If there is declaration have the same @param without the `new` keyword -> do not create a new obj, just another ptr to the same object
> > [!example]
>  > ```java
>  >BankAccount acc1 = new BankAccount("Han", 1000); // create a new obj
>  >BankAccount acc2 = BankAccount("Han", 1000); // Do not create a new obj, acc2 point to obj1
>  > ```

* Use obj's public attributes and pulic method:
```java
obj_name.attr_name;
obj_name.method_name(@param);
```
