## 1. Method overloading
* Each method has it own signature

> [!info] Method signature
> ![[Pasted image 20221115165326.png]] 

> [!info] Method overloading
> Methods in class can have the same name, if they have different signatures (different number of arguments or different types of arguments) 

> [!check] Advantages
> easier for devs since they don't have to remember too many method names.

* Methods are considered as **overloading** only if they belong to **the same class**.

> [!caution] Only apply this technique on methods describing the same kind of task

* Method overloading can be applied to **Constructor**

> [!info]  `this` keyword
> * Refer to the current obj, used **inside the class** of the obj that it refers to.
> * use attributes or methods of object through `.` operator
> > [!example] 
> > ```java
> > public class BankAccount{
> >	private String owner;
> >	public void setOwner(String owner){
> >		this.owner = owner;
> >	}
> >	public BankAccount() { 
> >		this.setOwner(“noname”); 
> >	}
> >…
> >}
> > ```

## 2. Class members and constant members
> [!info] Constant members
> Attribute/method that can not change its values/content during the usage.
> ```java
> access_modifier final data_type CONSTANT_VAR = value;
> ```

* Constants associated with a class are declared as `static final`

### Class members
* Members belong to:
	* The whole class (static)
	* Individual (instance variables and methods)
[[Java Modifiers]] 

> [!note] Static attributes and methods 
> belong to the class, declared with `static` modifier
> > [!caution] Changing a value in one obj changes the val for all of the objs
> 
> * Can be accessed without instanting the class

|Instance member|Class member|
|---|---|
|Attributes/methods can **only be accessed via obj**|Attributes/methods can be accessed through class|
|Each obj has it own copy of an obj's attribute|All objects have thhe same copy of class attributes|
|Values of an attribute of different objects are different|Values of a class attribute of different objs are the same.|

> [!caution] 
> Static methods can access **only staic attributes** and can **call static methods** in the same class.

## 3. Passing arguments to methods

* Can pass primitive **data types** (int, double, char...) or **references** (array and obj)

### Variable Arguments
* An arbitrary number of arguments, called ***varargs*** (nói đơn giản là cho nhập số lượng ko giới hạn các @param có chung dạng dữ liệu)
[Read more about Java Varargs](https://viblo.asia/p/java-core-tat-tan-tat-ve-varargs-trong-java-WAyK8reelxX)

> [!note] Declare an varargs method
> ```java
> <Data_type>...<param_name>
> ```

```java
public int sum(int ... nums){
	int result = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++){
		result += nums[i];
	}
	return result;
}

sum();// return 0
sum(1,2)//return 3
sum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) //return 15
```

>[!caution]
>* Varargs must be **the last @param**
>* There is only **one varargs passed** in a method

### Passing by values
> [!info]
> Java passes all arguments to a method in form of pass-by-value (Passing value/copy of the real argument)

> [!note] With value-based date type
> * Primitive values can not be changed when being passed as a @param

```java
public void method2(int a){
	a = a +2;
}

public void method1(){
	int a = 0;
	System.out,println(a); // print out 0
	method2(a);
	System.out.println(a);// print out 0
}
```

> [!note] With reference-based data type
> Pass the references by value, not the original reference or the object
> ![[Pasted image 20221115233045.png]]

> [!quote] But what if we want to swap two Object ? 

> [!check] We call out a wrapper class

```java
// Java program to Demonstrate that Wrapper Classes
// Can be Used to Swap two Objects

// Class 1
// A car with model and no.
class Car {
	// Attributes associated with car
	int model, no;

	// Constructor of class 1
	Car(int model, int no)
	{
		// This refers to current instance itself
		this.model = model;
		this.no = no;
	}

	// Method
	// To print object details
	void print()
	{
		System.out.println("no = " + no
						+ ", model = " + model);
	}
}

// Class 2
// Wrapper over class that is used for swapping
class CarWrapper {
	Car c;

	// Constructor
	CarWrapper(Car c) { this.c = c; }
}

// Class 3
// Uses Car class and swaps objects of Car
// using CarWrapper
class GFG {
	// This method swaps car objects in wrappers
	// cw1 and cw2
	public static void swap(CarWrapper cw1, CarWrapper cw2)
	{
		Car temp = cw1.c;
		cw1.c = cw2.c;
		cw2.c = temp;
	}

	// Main driver method
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		Car c1 = new Car(101, 1);
		Car c2 = new Car(202, 2);
		CarWrapper cw1 = new CarWrapper(c1);
		CarWrapper cw2 = new CarWrapper(c2);
		swap(cw1, cw2);
		cw1.c.print();
		cw2.c.print();
	}
}

```
