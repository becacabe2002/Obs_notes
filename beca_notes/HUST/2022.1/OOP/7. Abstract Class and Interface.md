## 1. Redefine/Overriding
* A child class can define a method with the same name of a method in its parent class:

> [!info] Method Overloading
> If the new method has the same name but different signature (number or data types of method's arguments)

> [!info] Method Overriding (Re-definition)
> If the new method has the same name and signature

* Overriding method will **replace or add more details** to the overriden method in the parent class.

* Objs of child class will **use the re-defined method**.

> [!note] `this` and `super`
> Can use non-static methods/attributes and constructors 
>>[!example]
>>```java
>>// current obj
>>	this() // constructor from the other of the same class
>>	this // refer to the current obj
>>
>>// Parent class
>>	super() // constructor of the parent class
>>	super //refer to the parent class
>>```

### Overriding Rules
> [!note] Overriding methods must have:
> * An argument list that is the same as the overidden method in the parent class (signature)
> * The same return data types as the overidden method in the parent class.

> [!failure] Can not override:
> * **Constant (final) methods** in the parent class
>  * **Static methods** in the parent class
>  * **Private methods** in the parent class

> [!caution] Accessibility can not be more restricted in a child class

Ex: if a **protected** class is overrided, the overriding class can not have **private** modifier but only **protected** or **public**

> [!example]-
> ```java
> class Parent{
> 	public void doSth(){}
> 	public int doSth2(){
> 		return 0;
> 	}
> }
> class Child extends Parent{
> 	protected void doSth(){} // cannot override, since have a more restricted access privileges (protected > public)
> 	protected void doSth2(){} // cannot overrid, since have different return type
> }
> 
> ```

## 2. Abstract class
> [!info] Abstract class 
> A class that **can not create its objs**, used to define **Generic concepts**, and playing the role of a basic class for others **detailed** classes.

```java
public abstract class class_name{
...
}
```

* Often used as a parent class.
	* Its children will complement the un-completed parts.

> [!note] 
> * Abstract class can contain abstract methods
> 
> * Derived class that are no abstract must implement these abstract methods.
> 
> * Abstract classes on parent class must not be declared as `final` or `static` since child classes must implement the details of their parent's abstract classes.
> > [!caution] If a class has one or more abstract methods, it must be  an abstract class.

> [!example]-
> ```java
> abstract class Point{
> 	private int x, y;
> 	public Point (int x, int y){
> 		this.x = x;
> 		this.y = y;
> 	}
> 	public void move(int dx, int dy){
> 		x += dx; y += dy;
> 		plot();
> 	}
> 	public abstract void plot(); // abstract method
> }
> abstract class ColoredPoint extends Point{
> 	int color;
> 	public ColoredPoint(int x, int y, int color){
> 		super(x,y);
> 		this.color = color;
> 	}
> }
> class SimpleColoredPint extends ColoredPoint{
> 	public SimpleColoredPoint(int x, int y, int color){
> 		super(x,y,color);
> 	}
> 	public void plot(){
> 	//code blocks
> 	}
> } 
> public void main (String[] args){
> 	Point p = new SimpleColoredPoint(a,b,red);
> 	p.plot();
> }
> ``` 

## 3. Single inheritance and multi-inheritance
>[!info] Multiple Inheritance
>* A class can inheritance several other classes
>* C++ supports multiple inheritance

[C++ multi-inheritance](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multiple-inheritance-in-c/#:~:text=Multiple%20Inheritance%20is%20a%20feature,is%20called%20before%20A's%20constructor.)

> [!info] Single Inheritance
> * A class can inherit only one other class.
> * Java supports only single inheritance.
> 
> -> Need to add the **notion of Interface**

### Problems in Multiple Inheritance
* Name clashes on attributes or operations
![[Pasted image 20221121094455.png]]
* Repeated inheritance
![[Pasted image 20221121094514.png]]
>[!check] 
>Implementation-dependent

## 4. Interface
* Corresponds to different implementations
* Defines the border:
	* What and How
	* Declaration and Implementation

> [!info] Interface
>  Is an abstract "class" that is used to **group related methods** with "empty" bodies.

> [!note]
> * Interface allows a class to inherit (implement) multiple interfaces at the same time.
> * Can not directly instantiate (khởi tạo)

>[!note] Syntax
>```java
>SubClass extends SuperClass implements ListOfInterfaces
>//
>SubInterface extends SuperInterface
>```

```java
import java.awt.Graphics;
abstract class Shape {
	protected String name;
	protected int x, y;
	Shape(String n, int x, int y) {
		name = n; this.x = x; this.y = y;
	}
	public String getName() {
		return name;
	}
	public abstract float calculateArea();
}
interface Actable {
	public void draw(Graphics g);
	public void moveTo(Graphics g, int x1, int y1);
	public void erase(Graphics g);
}
class Circle extends Shape implements Actable {
	private int radius;
	public Circle(String n, int x, int y, int r){
		super(n, x, y); radius = r;
	}
	public float calculateArea() {
		float area = (float) (3.14 * radius * radius);
	return area;
	}
	public void draw(Graphics g) {
		System out println("Draw circle at ("+ x + "," + y + ")");
		g.drawOval(x-radius,y-radius,2*radius,2*radius);
	}
	public void moveTo(Graphics g, int x1, int y1){
		erase(g); x = x1; y = y1; draw(g);
	}
	public void erase(Graphics g) {
	System out println("Erase circle at ("+ x + "," + y + ")");
// paint the region with background color...
	}
}
```

![[Pasted image 20221121104806.png]]

```java
// InterfaceExample.java
interface WattleBottleInterface{
// only accept static and final attributes
	String color = "Blue";
// methods have to be abstract.
	void fillUp();
	void pourOut();
}
public class InterfaceExample implements WaterBottleInterface{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		System.out.println(color);
		InterfaceExample ex = new InterfaceExample();
		ex.fillUP();
	}
// all abstract methods of the interface have to be implemented in concrete classs
	@Override
	public void fillUp(){
		... // blocks of code
	}
	@Override
	public void pourOut(){
		...//blocks of code
	}
	
}
```
