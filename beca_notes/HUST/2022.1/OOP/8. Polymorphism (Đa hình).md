## 1. Upcasting and Downcasting
### Upcasting
> [!info] Upcasting
> The capacity to view an obj of a derived class as an obj of its base class.

* Moving **up** the **inheritance hierarchy**

> [!check]  Auto **type conversion** (implicity)

> [!example]
> ![[Pasted image 20221203204023.png]] 
> ```java
> public class Test1{
> class Manager extends Employee {
> 	Employee assistant;
> 	// ....
> 	public void setAssitant(Employee e){
> 		assistant = e;
> 	}
> 	// ...
> 	
> }
> String static teamInfo(Person 1, Person 2){
> 	return "Leader: " + p1.getName() + ", member: " + p2.getName();
> }
> public static void main(String[] args){
> 	// --- Test 1
> 	Person p;
> 	Employee e = new Employee();
> 	p = e; //upcasting
> 	p.setname("Hoa");
> 	p.setSalary(5000); // error when compile
> 	Employee e1 = (Employee) p; // downcasting - have to cast type explicitly
> 	e1.setSalary(12000); // no errors occured 
> 	// --- Test 2
> 	Manager junior, senior;
> 	// ..
> 	senior.setAssistant(junior);
> 	// --- Test 3
> 	Employee e1, e2;
> 	Manager m1, m2;
> 	// ... 
> 	System.out.println(teamInfo(e1, e2))
> 	System.out.println(teamInfo(m1, m2))
> 	System.out.println(teamInfo(m1, e2))
> 	
> 	}
> }
> ```
```
```

### Downcasting
> [!info] Downcasting
> Capacity to view an obj of a base class as an obj of its derived class.

* Moving back down the inheritance hierarchy

> [!warning] Does not convert types automatically
> -> Must cast types explicitly.

> [!example] 
> ```java
> public class Test2{
> public static void main(String[] args){
> 	Employee e = new Employee();
> 	Person p  = e; // upcasting
> 	Employee ee = (Employee) p; // downcasting
> 	Manager m = (Manager) ee; // violeted compiler's trust (since ee was not in a specific type)
> 	//-> ClassCastException will be thrown at runtime
> 	Person p2 = new Manager();
> 	Employee e2 = (Employee) p2; // upcasting then downcasting
> 	Person p3 = new Employee();
> 	Manager e3 = (Manager) p3;
> 	}
> }
> ```

> [!tip] Accessibility 
> * Upcasting gives obj the accessibility to access all the parent class members, but **not all the members of child class**, but only **overidden methods**.

## 2. Static and dynamic bindings
#### Function call binding
> [!info] Function call binding
> A procedure to specify the piece of code that need to be executed when calling a func

Ex: in C language, every func has a unique name

#### Method call binding
* For OOP languages (Java)
> [!info] Method call binding
> * For independent classes (not in any inheritance tree), the procedure is almost the same as func call binding.
> * Compare func name, argument list to find the corresponding definition.

### Static Binding
> [!info] Static binding
> Binding at the compiling time (early binding)
> * Function call is done when compiling -> One instance of the function
> * Any error will cause a compiling error
> 
> > [!check] Have the advantage of speed 

* C/C++ func call binding, and C++ method binding are examples of static func call binding.

> [!example] 

```java
class NewClass{
	public static class superclass{
		static void print(){
		System.out.println("Printed by superclass.");
		}
	}
	public static class subclass extends superclass{
		static void print(){
		System.out.println("Printed by subclass.");
		}
	}
	public static void main(String[] args){
		superclass A = new superclass();
		superclass B = new subclass();// downcasting 
		A.print();
		B.print(); 
	}
} 
```

```shell
Printed by superclass.
Printed by superclass. // since
```

**Explain**: 
* One obj of subclass and one obj of superclass with the reference of the superclass were created.
* Since the print method of the superclass is static, the compiler knows that it will not be overidden in subclasses and hence compiler knows during compile time which print  method to call and hence no ambiguity.

### Dynamic Binding
> [!info] Dynamic binding
> The method call is done at run-time (late binding)
> * Instance of method is suitable for called obj.

* Java uses dynamic binding (by default)

> [!example] 

```java
public class CFG{
	public static class superclass{
		void print(){
		System.out.println("Printed by superclass.");
		}
	}
	public static class subclass extends superclass{
		@Override void print(){
			System.out.println("Printed by subclass.");
		}
	}
	public static void main(String[] args){
	superclass A = new superclass();
	superclass B = new subclass();
	A.print();
	B.print();
	}
}
```

```shell
Printed by superclass.
Printed by subclass.
```

**Explain**:
* Methods are not static in this code.
* During compilation, the compiler has no idea as to which print has to be called since the compiler goes only by referencing variable not by the type of obj, and therefore the binding would be **delayed to runtime** and therefore the corresponding version of the print will be called based on type on an object. 

|<b>Static Binding</b>|<b>Dynamic Binding</b>|
|---|---|
|Take place at compile time|Take place at runtime|
|Take place using normal funcs|Take place using virtual funcs|
|Never used by real obj|Used by real obj|

### Linker and Loader
![[Pasted image 20221203223202.png]]

> [!info] Linker
> Special prog that combines the obj files, generated by compiler/assembler and other pieces of code to originate an executable file has **.exe** extension.

* In obj file, linker searches and append all libs needed for execution of file.

* It regulates the mem space that will hold the code from each module.

* It also merges two or more separate obj progs and establishes links among them.

> [!info] Loader
> Special prog that takes input of executable files from linker, loads it to main mem, and prepares this code for execution by computer.

* Loader allocates mem space to prog.

* It also settles down [sybomlic reference](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17406159/symbolic-references-in-java) between objs.

* It loads progs (Module) and libs in OS.

## 3. Polymorphism
> [!info] Polymorphism
> Multiple ways of performance, of existance.

> [!note] Polymorphism inn OOP
> * **Method polymorphism** 
> 	* Method overloading (same name, but different in arguments list)
> * **Obj polymorphism**
> 	* Multiple types - single obj to represent multiple different types (upcasting and downcasting)
> 	* Multiple implementations/behaviors - single interface  ([[7. Abstract Class and Interface#4. Interface]]) to obj of different types. (Upcasting, downcasting + dynamic binding)
> 
> 	[[8. Polymorphism (Đa hình)#1. Upcasting and Downcasting]] + [[8. Polymorphism (Đa hình)#Dynamic Binding]]

> [!faq]  WHY WE NEED POLYMORPHISM?
> Cause we need to hide many different implementations behind a single interface.

### Static methods
![[Java Modifiers#^28f918]]

* Static methods are inherited, but **can not be overridden.**

* If  a derived class defines a static method with the same signature as a static method in the base class, the method in the derived class is **hidden by the method in the base class**.

* Static methods are not polymorphic. At the compile time, the static method will be statically linked.

```java
class Base{
	public static void display(){
		System.out.println("Static or class method from Base.");
	}
	public void print(){
		System.out.println("Non-static or Instance method from Base.");
	}
}

class Derived extends Base{
	public static void display(){
		System.out.println("Static or class method from Derived.");
	}
	public void print(){
		System.out.println("Non-static or Instance method from Derived.");
	}
}
public class Test{
	public static void main(String[] ars){
		Base obj1 = new Derived();
		obj1.display();
		obj1.print();
	}

}

```

```shell
Static or class method from Base.
Non-static or Instance method from Derived.
```

## 4. Generic programming
> [!info] Generic programming
> Generalizing program so that it can work with different data types (including some future data types).

* Example:
	* C: using pointer void
	* C++: using template
	* Java: take advantage of upcasting
	* Java 1.5: template

> [!example] Java upcasting
```java
class MyStack{
	...
	public void push(Object obj){
	...
	}
	public Object pop(){
	...
	}
	public class TestStack(){
		MyStack s = new MyStack();
		Point p = new Point();
		Circle c = new Circle();
		s.push(p); s.push(c)// upcasting
		Circle c1 = (Circle) s.pop();// downcasting
		Point p1 = (Point) s.pop();// downcasting
	}
}
```

> [!example] Java Template

```java
// without template
List myList = new LinkedList();
myList.add(new Integer(0));
Integer x = (Integer) myList.iterator().next();

// with template
List<Integer> myList  = new LinkedList<Integer>();// List type
myList.add(new Integer(0));
Integer x = myList.iterator().next();
// myList.add(new Long(0)); -> Compile error
```

### Java generic data structure
> [!info] Collection 
> a collection of objs
> * ***List*** - a collection of objs that are sequential (tuần tự), consecutive and repeatable.
> * ***Set*** - a collection of objs that are not repeatable

> [!info] Map
> Collection of key-value pairs (key is unique).
> * Linking objs in this set to other sets as a dictionary/a telephone book.

![[Pasted image 20221204222215.png]]

#### a. Interface Collection
* Specifies basic interface for manipulating a set of objs 
	* Add to collection
	* Remove from collection
	* Check if existing
* Contains methods to manipulate individual objs or a set of objs
* Provide methods to traverse objs in a repeatable collection and convert a collection to an array.
👉[More about Collection interface](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Collection.html)

#### b. Interface Map
* Basic interface for manipulating a set  of pairs key-value
	* Add a pair key-value
	* Remove a pair key-value
	* Get a value of a given key
	* Check if existing (key or value)
* 3 views for the content of collections
	* Key collection
	* Value collection
	* Mapping collection of key-value
👉[More about Map interface](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Map.html)

#### c. Iterator
* Provide a mechanism to visit (repeat) all the members of a collection (similar to SQL cursor)
* ListIterator has methods to show the sequential attribute of the basic list
* Iterator of a sorted collection will visit in the sorting order

### Defining and using Template
> [!note] [Generic Types](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/java-generics-example-method-class-interface)

> [!note] Type Parameter Naming Conventions
> -   **E** - Element (used extensively by the Java Collections Framework)
> -   **K** - Key
> -   **N** - Number
> -   **T** - Type
> -   **V** - Value
> -   **S,U,V** etc. - 2nd, 3rd, 4th types

> [!example] Using template

```java
class MyStack<T> {
	...
	public void push(T x){
		...
	}
	public T pop(){
		...
	}

}
public class Test{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		MyStack<Integer> s1 = new MyStack<Integer>();
		s1.push(new Integer(0));
		Integer x = s1.pop();
		// s1.push(new Long(0)); -> Error
		MyStack<Long> s2 = new MyStack<Long>();
		s2.push(new Long(0));
		Long y = s2.pop; 
	}

}
```

**Defining Iterator**

```java
public interface List<E>{
	void add(E x);
	Iterator<E> iterator();
}
public interface Interator<E>{
	E next();
	boolean hasNext();
}
class LinkedList<E> implements List<E>{
// implementation
}
```
