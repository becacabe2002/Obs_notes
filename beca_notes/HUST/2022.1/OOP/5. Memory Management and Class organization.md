## 1. Memory management in Java

* Java does not use ptr, hence memory address **can not be overwritten** accidentally or intentionally.

* The allocation or re-alloc of mem, management of mem that is controlled by JVM, are **transparent with devs**

* Devs don't need to care about the allocated mem in heap to free it later.

* [[Heaps]]
* [[Stacks]]
> [!note] Stack
>* Local val in Stack mem is used as a reference pointer to Heap.
>* Val of primitive data is written directly in Stack.

 > [!note] Heap
>* Used to write information created by operator `new`.

```java
String s = new String("hello"); // s is ptr to str "hello" in Heap
String t = s; // t is also a ptr to str "hello" (copy address of ptr s)
int i = 201; //
int j = i;
```

### Garbage collector
> [!info] Garbage collector
> Sweep through the JVM's list of obj periodically and reclaims the resources held by unreferenced obj
> * Ref out of scope, objects to which u have assigned null, and so forth.

> [!question] When does GC run?
> - When the mem is low
> - May not be run at all
> - Unpredictable timing

* Cannot prevent GC from running, but can request (not guarantee)

```java
System.gc()// call out Garbage collector of JVM, but not guarantee
```

#### Java destructor? (technically no)
* **Deallocation of mem** is done automatically by the JVM (through the `finallize()` method)

#### `finalize()` method (deprecated)
* Process just like GC

* Sever asssociation between obj - obj reference by assigning another val to the obj reference.

> [!note] 
> Any class has `finalize()` executed right after the GC process takes place.

* Overide this method in some special cases in order to self-clean used resources when obj are freed by GC

### Object comparison
* ***Primitive data types***: use `==`
* ***Obj***: `==` check wether they refer to the same obj

```java
Class1 a = new Class1("abc");
Class1 b = a; 
// a == b -> return true

Class1 c = new("abc");
// a==c -> return false
```

#### `equals()` method
> [!caution] Can't be apply for primitive data types

```java
Class1 o1 = new Class1("name", 10, 15);
Class1 o2 = new Class1("name", 10, 15);
// o1 == o2 -> false
// o1.equals(o2) -> true
```

## 2. Class organization
[[3. Abstraction & Encapsulation#Package]]
* `java.lang` auto imported into all classes

### Fully qualified Class name
>[!note] Fully qualified class name
>* In the same package: class name
>* In different packages: contain **package name** + **class name** (if packages hasn't been imported)
>![[Pasted image 20221116080243.png]]

```java
import javax.swing.*;

String result = JOptionPane.showInputDialog("Enter a str:");
```

## 3. Utility classes in Java
### Wrapper Class
* Since primitive data types have no asssociated methods -> need a wrapper class

> [!info] Wrapper
> Corresponding classes for primitive data types, included in Java API
> * Each wrapper obj store a single primitive var
> * Offer methods which process the stored val
> ![[Pasted image 20221116081608.png]]

#### Converting data type with wrapper

```java
Interger i1 =  new Interger("10"); // i1 =10
String temp = i1.toString(i1) // temp = "10"
int i = Interger.parseInt("123"); // primitive var
Interger = Interger.valueOf("123"); // wrapper object
```

#### Constants
![[Pasted image 20221116082554.png]]

### String
> [!info] String
> Not a primitive data type, but a class, made up of any char between the double quotes.

```java
// initialized a string
String str1 = new String();
String str2 = new String("New String");
String str3 = String.valueOf(1.23);
String str4 = null;
```

```java
String a = "My " + "name " + "is Tu";// "My name is Tu"
System.out.println("Result is" + res) //auto convert primitive data types to string
```

#### String Literal vs String Object
>[!note]
>* When string literals are stored in String Constant Pool, String Objs are stored in **Heap**
>```java
>String s1 = ''New string''; // string literal
>String s2 = new String("New String"); // string obj
>```
> > [!info] String Constant Pool
> > an area in heap memory where Java stores literal string values

#### String buffer/String Builder
* String is an immutable type
>[!caution] 
>String concatention will create a new obj to store the result -> memory comsuming

> [!check] `StringBuffer` and `StringBuilder`
> Mutable type that can change value after being created.
> 

```java
StringBuffer strb = new StringBuffer("Halo");
StringBuffer strb_temp = strb;
strb.append(" hiha"); // strb point to "Halo hiha"
// strb_temp == strb -> true since strb not change
```
