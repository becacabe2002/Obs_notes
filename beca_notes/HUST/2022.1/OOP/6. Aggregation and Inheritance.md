## 1. Source code re-usability
> [!info] Source code re-usability
> Re-use already existing source code.

* Structure programming: re-use func/sub-program

* OOP: when modeling real world, there exist many obj types that have similar or related attributes and behaviors.

> [!question] How to use existing classes?
> * Copying existing classes -> Redundant and difficult to manage changes
> * Creating new classes that **re-use of objects of existing classes** -> ***Aggregation*** (tổng hợp)
> * Creating new classes **based on the extension of existing classes** -> ***Inheritance***

> [!Check] Advantages
> - Reducing man-power, cost.
> - Improving software quality.
> - Improving modeling capacity of the real world.
> - Improving maintainability

## 2. Aggregation (tổng hợp)
> [!info] Aggregation
> The whole class contains obj of member classes
> * Is-a-part (là một phần) of the whole class
> * Reuse data and behavior of member classes via member objs

> [!note] Representing aggregation in UML
> * Using **Diamond** at the head of whole class
> 
> * Using **multiplicity** at two heads:
> 	* Positive integer: 1,2,3,4
> 	* Range: (0..1, 2..4)
> 	* `*`: any number
> 	* **none** : equal 1 by default
> 
> * role name : if they dont have, by default is class name (uncapitalize the first word)

### Initialization order in aggregation
* When an ob is created, the attributes of that obj must be initialized and assigned corresponding values.

* Member obj must be initialized first
>[!caution] Constructor methods of member classes must be called first.

## 3. Inheritance
*A quadrangle has 4 points -> Aggregation*
*A square is an Quadrangle -> Inheritance*

> [!info] Inherit, Derive
> * Creating a new class by extending existing classes.
> * New class inherits members of existing classes and implement its own new features.

> [!note] Existing Class
> Parent class, superclassm, base class

> [!note] New Class
> Child class, subclass, derived class

### What is Inheritance?
* On **Modularization** view: *if B inherits A, all services of A will be available in B*

* On **Type** view: *If B inherits A, anywhere requires representation of A, B can replace A*

=> <mark>Polymorphism</mark>

> [!info] Child classes
> * **Is a kind of** parent 
> * Reuse by inheriting data and behavior of parent
> * Can be customized in two ways (or both):
> 	* **Extension**: add more new attributes/behaviors
> 	* **Redefinition (Method Overriding)**: modify the behavior inheriting from parent class.

### Aggregation and Inheritance

* **Both are OOP technique to reuse resource code**.

|Aggregation|Inheritance|
|:---|:---|
|Reuse source code via **Obj**. <br> Creating a reference to the obj of existing classes in the new class| Reuse source code via **Class**<br> Creating new class by extending existing classes.|
|<b>is-a-part-of</b> relation|<b>is-a-kind-of</b> relation|

> [!example] 
> Inheritance: Car is a kind of Transportation
> Aggregation: Car has 4 wheels

> [!note] Representing Inheritance in UML
> * Using **empty triangle** at parent class
> ![[Pasted image 20221120155254.png]]

### Inheritance hierarchy
> [!info]
> A hierachy structure, which represents inheritance relation between classes.

* ***Direct inheritance***: Sport Car <- Vehicle

* ***Indirect inheritance***: Car <- Vehicle

![[Pasted image 20221120155751.png]]

> [!note]
> * Child classes have the same parent class called **siblings**
> * A child class inherits features from all of its ancestors

> [!info] Class `Object`
> * Defined in the standard package `java.lang`
> 
> * If a class is not defined as a child of another class, it is by default a direct child of class `Object`.
> > [!check] Class Object is the root class in all hierachy trees

### Inheritance rules
![[Pasted image 20221120161138.png]]

> [!question]  What does a child class inherit?
> > [!note]
> > * All attributes/methods that are declared as public and protected in the parent class
> > * All members with the **default** access modifier, if child and parent classes are **in the same package**
> > * Does not inherit **private attributes/methods** and **Construction/destruction methods**

> [!example]  Example in Java

```java
<SubClass> extends <SuperClass>

// if they are in different class
import <PackageName>.<ClassName>
}
```

### Construction and Destruction of objs in Inheritance
> [!note] Obj Construction
> * Parent class is initialized before its child classes.
> * Construction methods of a child class always call construction methods of it parent class at the very first command.
> 	* Implicit call (khong ro rang)
> 	* Explicit call

> [!note] Obj Destruction
> Contrary to obj initialization.

#### Explicit constructor call of parent class
* The first  cmd in constructor of a child class can explicit call the constructor of its parent class

```java
super(list_of_params);
```

> [!caution] 
> This is obliged if the parent class does not have any default constructor
> * Parent class already has a constructor with arguments
> * The constructor of child class must not have arguments

![[Pasted image 20221120210210.png]]
![[Pasted image 20221120210221.png]]

#### Implicit call of constructors
![[Pasted image 20221120210241.png]]
* When initializing an obj, a serie of constructors will be called explicitly (via `super()` or implicity call)

* Constructor of the most basic class in the  hierarchy tree will be called last, but will finish first. The constructor of the derived class will finish at the last.

#### Implicit call of `finalize()`
* Inverse compared to the call of constructors
