> The constant increase in data processing speeds and bandwith, the nonstop invention of new tools for creating, sharing and consuming data, and the steady addition of new data creators and consumers around the world, ensure that data growth continues unabated (không suy giảm). Data begets more data in a constant virtuous cycle.

* Interconnected

* Independent 

* Continuall evolving

* Data Sources consists of **Structured** and **Unstructured** data.

## Steps on working with data

### 1️⃣ Pull a copy of data from the source into a data repo

```start-multi-column
ID: ID_etlb
Number of Columns: 2
Largest Column: standard
border: off
```

* Only looking for needed data
* Working with data **formats**, **sources** and **interfaces** through which this data can be pulled.
* Have to ensure:
	* The RELIABILITY
	* The SECURITY
	* The INTEGRITY

Raw data needs to be organized, cleaned up, optimized for access and conform (tuân thủ) to compliances and standards enforced in the org 

* Challenges:
	* Data management
	* Require repos that provide high AVAILABILITY, FLEXIBILITY, ACCESSIBILITY and SECURITY

* Challenges: 
	* Interfaces 
	* APIs
	* Applications

## Emerging technologies shaping the modern data ecosystem

* Every enterprise has access to limitless storage, high-performance computing, open source techs, ML techs and the lasted tools and libs.

* DSs now can create predictive models by training machine learning algorithm with past data.

* Big Data is paving the way for new tools and techniques, and also new knowledge and insights.
