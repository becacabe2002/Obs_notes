* 3 forms of data:
	* Structured
	* Semi-structured
	* Unstructured

> [!info] Structured Data
> * Data follows a rigid (chặt chẽ) format an can be organized into rows and columns.
> 
> Ex: in DB or Spreadsheets

> [!info] Semi-structured Data
> * Mix of data that has consistent characteristics, with data that does not conform to a rigid structure.
> 
> Ex: email

> [!info] Unstructured Data
> * Complex data and qualitative information, which can't be structured into rows and columns
> 
> Ex: media kinds, pdf, text files, ...

==Specify data type can help choose the kind of data repos for collecting and storing data, as well as pick right tools used for querying or processing data.==

> [!note] There is a wide range of file formats that data come in.
> * Relational DB
> * Non-Relational DB
> * APIs
> * Web Services
> * Data Streams
> * Social Platforms
> * Sensor Devices

> [!note] Data Repositories
> * DB, data warehouse, data marts, data lakes, big data stores.
> * Type, source and file format can drive what kind of data repo used to collect, store, clean, analyze and mine data.

Ex: working with big data -> need:
* big data warehouses : to store and process large-volume, high velocity data 
* frameworks: to perform complex analytics in real-time on big data.

### Languages in Data Ecosystem
* ***Query languages*** - querying and manipulating data (SQL)

* ***Programming languages*** - developing data applications (Python)

* ***Shell and Scripting languages*** - for repetitive operational tasks ()
