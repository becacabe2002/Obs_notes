|Relational DB|Non-relational DB|
|---|---|
|- Data is organized into a tabular format with rows and columns. </br>- Well-defined structure and schema.</br>- Optimized for data operations and querying.|- Emerged in response to the volume, diversity, and speed at which data is being generated. </br>- Built for speed, flexibility and scale</br>- Data can be stored in a schema-less form</br>-Widely used for processing big data.|
