## Event-driven programs and UI-developments
- Concept of event-driven vs procedural programs
- Flow-chart starts when button is clicked
- UI event listeners
- Concept of 'view state' in UI based programs
- User drives the program vs program drives the user

## Android Concepts
- [ ] Android **Activity Lifecycle**
- [ ] Android **Components**: Activity, Service, Receivers, Providers
- [ ] **Intents** for launching other Activities/Apps
- [ ] Ids, relations and dp/sp measurements in XML
- [ ] `onClickListener`, `findViewById` & **view-binding**
- [ ] `ListView`, `RecyclerView` and **Dynamic Data**
## Architecture and State Management in UI-based apps
- [ ] MVC, MVP, **MVVM** and the concept of MV* pattern
- [ ] **Synchronising** state and data between model and view
- [ ] Separation of concerns
- [ ] **Stateless** and **stateful** components
- [ ] **Presistence** of state
- [ ] **Propagation** (lan truy·ªÅn) of events
## Android Architecture Components
- [ ] **Fragements** and their lifecycle
- [ ] ViewModel, LiveData and Repository Pattern for MVVM Apps
- [ ] Saving and Restoring **state across app** and activity restarts
- [ ] Saving Data in Local DB using **SQLite** and **Room** (ORM)
## Advanced Language/Platform Concepts
- [ ] Advanced Multi-threading. Thread-pool executors
- [ ] Race conditions, Synchronized, Volatile
- [ ] OOP Design Patterns: Builder, Factory, Singleton
- [ ] HLD Patterns:
    - [ ] Clean Architecture, Domain Driven Development
    - [ ] Modularization
    - [ ] Dependency Injection, Dagger/Hilt/Koin
- [ ] _RxJava and Reactive_
## Advanced Android Concepts
- [ ] Runtime-permission managements
- [ ] Background tasks, WorkManager, AlaramManager
- [ ] Android OS providers - Contacts, SMS, Storage access APIs
- [ ] Audio/Video, Local and streaming with ExoPlayer
- [ ] GPS, LocationManager, Google Maps API
- [ ] Android Sensor framework, gesture detection
- [ ] Firebase Analytics, Push Notifications, ML Kit
## Android Testing and Automation
- [ ] Unit Testin and Instrumentation Testing in Android Projects
- [ ] Robo Scripts, Espresso Tests
- [ ] Mockito, Mokka mocking frameworks
- [ ] CI/CD integrations, build and deploy pipelines.
## Large Android Projects
- Managing Projects with 100+ gradle modules
- Custom gradle build scripts (using alternatives like Buck, Bazel)
- Custom View components (using Kotlin instead of XML)
- Custom patterns for RecyclerViews, BaseActivity, BaseFragment with common reusable components
- Detecting memory leaks with LeakCanary
- Performance Optimization through Android Profiler
